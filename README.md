# Implementation-of-genetic-algorithm-for-weight-initialization-in-MLP-network

- The code can be executed using the executable file named "Final_GUI_6"
- In case the GUI is not showing using the executable file, there might be some problem with libraries,
	the code can be executed by running the "Final_GUI_6.py" file.
- The GUI appears, user input parameters can be given as following:
	Image1: SalinasA_corrected.mat
	Image2: SalinasA_gt.mat
	Number of generations = 100
	No. Of parents mating = 40
	Mutation probability  = 0.02
	Crossover probability = 0.80
	Hidden layers = 10
	Population Size = 80
	No. of hidden nodes = [25, 50, 75, 100, 125
			125, 100, 75, 50, 25]
	Low weight value = -20
	Higher weight value = +20
	
- After this is done, a plot of generation and acccuracy is shown, it can also be saved futher.
- A csv file will be asked to save at a user defined name and location using GUI and an Image file will
	be similarily saved.
